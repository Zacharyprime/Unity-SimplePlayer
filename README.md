# Unity-SimplePlayer
A basic player controller for Unity

Place the look controller on the player's head, then put the first person camera as a child of the head.

If your player does not have a "head" object, then put it on the first person view camera.


Put the playerController on your player, if you do not have an object representing "player", then just create an empty game object and name it player, then put all the parts of your player inside the empty game object.
